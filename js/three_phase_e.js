		"<p><strong>Ans:</strong> &nbsp;In&nbsp; 3 phase loco NiCD Battery is used. There are total 78 cells in the batteries which are placed in 2 boxes at either side of the locomotive. Each box contains 39 cells and each battery has 3 cells. Capacity of battery is 199 A-H and output is 110 V. To charge the battery, one battery charger is provided with circuit breaker no. 110 situated in SB2. Main switch for battery is 112 which is placed in a box provided near battery box no. 2. For control circuit supply &nbsp;MCB no. 112.1 is provided in SB2. To show the battery voltage UBA is provided in either cab.</p><p><strong><u>Note:-</u></strong><br/>1. If battery voltage is 92 V for more than 30 seconds, P-2 Fault will appear on the screen.<br/>2. If charging current is reduced by 10 A, P-2 fault will appear on screen.<br/>3. If battery voltage is reduced below 82 V, P-1 message with shutdown of loco will appear.<br/>4. If cab is activated and panto is lowered than 10 minutes CE will switch off automatically.<br/>5. Loco CE get power supply directly from battery and can supply up to maximum 5 hours.<br/>6.
