		"<strong>Ans: Transformers used on loco:-<u></u></strong><br />Mainly two kinds of transformers have been used on loco&ndash; Auto and step down transformers.<br />The main transformer of the loco is an Auto transformer and all other transformer used are step down transformers.<br /><strong>Checks against over current:-</strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The main (TFWR) the auxiliary (TFWA) and the Traction (TFP) transformers of the locomotive is protected from over current by the over current relay QLM . In case there is over current in the transformer, QLM will act and cause tripping of DJ by opening its normally close interlock on MTDJ and its&nbsp; target will come out.<br /><strong>GR and transformer oil level checks:</strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>At the time of taking over charge of the locomotive the oil level of graduator (GR) is required to be checked which should be between +200&nbsp;and - 200 mark, otherwise the matter is to be reported to the higher authorities.<br />Transformer oil level should not be below 150 centigrade mark.<br /><strong>51.05</strong><br /><strong>Transformer oil cooling arrangement:-</strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The main transformer of the locomotive is energized with a very high voltage of 25 K.V. so it becomes hot. An arrangement should be there for cooling the transformer form getting excessively hot. So there is provision for cooling the transformer by circulating oil around it through radiator. An auxiliary motor MPH (an oil pump) is provided for pumping oil around transformer, MPH stars working along with ARNO as soon as DJ is closed. There is provision for cooling the transformer oil also. A blower motor MVRH is used to cool the transformer oil which starts on closing the switch BLVMT on the driver&rsquo;s desk.</p>",
		"Ans: <strong>Introduction: -</strong> This circuit is responsible for transmission of voltage from traction transformer to traction motors and ultimately for moving the locos. It works on 650v D.C voltage after being tapped from the main transformer is supplied to traction transformer primary (TFP) and the traction secondary transformers are energized by induction. Then via RSI block, SL, line contactor and reverser it reaches the traction motor and the loco moves.</p><p><strong>Equipments of traction power circuit and their functions: -</strong></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TFP (Traction power transformer): -</strong> It is fixed ratio transformer which consists of one primary and two separate secondary winding for two separate RSI blocks.<br /><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RSI (Silicon rectifier block): -</strong> The source of supply of current to the locomotive is A.C but the traction motor provided in the locomotive are D.C motor. So A.C is required to be converted into D.C. &amp; this conversion is done by the RSI block. There are separate RSI blocks for two separate secondary windings. RSI-1 for TMs &ndash; 1, 2 &amp; 3 and RSI &ndash; 2 for TMs &ndash; 4, 5 &amp; 6.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silicon cells (Diode): -</strong> Generaly there are 64 silicone cells (Diode) in a RSI block of WAG-5 loco, which consists of four arms. Each arm of the block has 16 cells. These cells convert A.C. into pulsating D. C. Some locos are provided with RSI block of different make and having different numbers of silicon cells.</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell Tale fuse (Signaling fuse): -</strong> Each RSI block is provided with 4/7 bridges connected in parallel and protected by Bridge-Fuses (HRC Fuse). In the event of failure of any of the bridges, the bridge fuse blows, triggering, in turn, the Tell- Tale fuse which lights up a signal lamp LSRSI in the driver&rsquo;s desk<em>.</em></p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QRSI: -</strong> This is an over current relay which checks over current in the RSI blocks. There are two QRSI &mdash;QRSI 1&nbsp;for RSI block no.-1 and QRSI2&nbsp;for RSI block no-2. If there is over current in any RSI block, the concerning QRSI will act and cause tripping of DJ.</p><p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoothening Reactors (SL1 and SL2): -</strong> The A.C current after getting rectified in the RSI block, is a pulsating D.C and not pure D.C hence this pulsating D.C is further passed through the smoothening reactor to make it pure D.C. there are two SL- SL1 for RSI block no: -1 and SL2 for RSI block no.-2.</p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line contactors (L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5 &amp; L-6):-</strong> These are electro pneumatic contactors provided to connect the traction motors with the RSI blocks, with each line contactor one traction motor is connected.
