		"<p><strong>Answer :</strong><br />During AOH/IOH over hauling of MVMT is done. Motor with blower bring to testing and over hauling area after removing from locomotive. Overhauling is done in following stage:</p><p><strong>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretest:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />visual inspection for any damage and ensure for free movement of motor . Meggering is done to ensure megger value of winding with motor body. It should be more than 10 M ohm. If IR value is satisfactory then give external 3 phase supply&nbsp; and check any abnormal sound or vibration from bearing of&nbsp; motor or blower assembly. If observed any abnormality then dismantle the blower and again run motor. This way we can decide that whether the fault in motor or blower unit. With blower and without blower note the current&nbsp; drawn by motor.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Dismantling:</strong><br />Unscrew bolts from drive end and remove grease cover.

Unscrew bolts and remove bearing cover from non driveend . Dismantles non drive end shied from bearing . If the bearing is any way defective then only we have to change it. To replace the bearing , remove circlip from non drive end , using a standard bearing puller , remove both drive end &amp; non drive end bearings from rotor shaft.<br /><strong>&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleaning :</strong><br /><strong>Stator :</strong>&nbsp; stator winding is first cleaned with compressed dry air . If IR value&nbsp; of stator winding is less then first clean&nbsp; stator with petrol&nbsp; &amp; dry air and put&nbsp; it into oven for dry up at 100deg cel. for four hours. Re-varnishing&nbsp; is done to improve IR value.<br /><strong>Rotor:</strong>Clean with petrol and dry air. Check visually for any crack. If required rotor dynamic balancing is to be done.<br /><strong>Bearing:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clean the bearing with petrol dry air.

		"<strong>Answer-</strong> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; LTBA is called battery surge arrestor. It is used to protect the battery and control circuit from high voltage circuit in locomotive. In locomotive, there are two system of power i.e. power circuit of high voltage separately for traction and auxiliary and control circuit of 110 volt. Due to any reasons if both the circuit is shorted will be result into damaging of control circuit, in that case LTBA got punctured and CCBA melted. LTBA body made of ceramic and maintained a gap for insulation. LTBA one end is connected with BA positive terminal (003) and other end is directly connected with ETO. In case of fault LTBA got high volt which puncture the same. As LTBA punctured causing CCBA melting and DJ tripping. This way control circuit is saved.</p>",
		"<p><strong>Answer :</strong> <br />In normal operation of locomotives, operator used master controller (MP) to increase&nbsp; or decreased the speed of traction motor by varying the input voltage. There have been made some arrangements in loco control circuit, in existence some predetermined fault in loco, automatically TFP notches reduced and control TM input voltage up to safe limit. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically Q51 relay is indirect responsible for auto regression. In four abnormal condition i.e. direct energization of Q20, QD/Q48, PR2 &amp;de-energization of QRS resulting into energization of Q51,which leads into auto-regression. Q20 over voltage protection relay for traction motor. QD/Q48 jointly work to control the current difference between TM of same bogie as&nbsp; required for the motor. During emergency or by any reason if BP drop to the preset value resulting energization of PR2. QRS should be in energized condition which ensure the proper availability of BP pressure in train pipe. Generally in higher notches auto &ndash; regression take place through Q20.</p>",
		"<strong>Answer :</strong><br />The accidental contact between the loco body and electrical circuit is called bonding. When negative cable of battery contacts the loco body is called negative bonding. The all LT circuits negative levels are grounded through a knife switch is called HOBA. It has two positions ON and OFF.</p><p>To check the negative bonding put the HBA &ldquo;1&rsquo;&rsquo; and keep HOBA at ON position. Take a test lamp of 110 Volt DC.&nbsp; Touch one terminal of test lamp to the loco body and other end to the positive cable of LT circuit.&nbsp; The lamp will glow bright. Now keep HOBA in OFF position. If the lamp becomes dim then negative bonding is not present but if the lamp glows in same brightness then negative bonding is present in the locomotive. <br />Procedure of negative bonding trouble shooting &ndash;<br />The negative cables of LT circuits are distributed mainly from three junction, they are Cab-1 and Cab-2 SB and BD.<br />To find out the negative bonding, HBA put off and keep the HOBA at neutral position. Take a continuity tester and check the proper function of tester. Disconnect cable no 302 and 303 in cab-1 SB TERMINAL and 304 AND 305 in cab-2 SB terminal which are coming from BD. One terminal of continuity tester is earthed properly and other end is touched with the negative cables one by one.&nbsp; After touching in which negative cable the tester lamp glows, this cable is caused for negative bonding. By the help of cable index check the cable lay out and detect equipment responsible for bonding.</p>",

		"<strong>Answer :</strong></p><p>A report indicating failure, withdrawal and any other technical abnormality in locomotive observed on line is called Unusual Occurrence Report (UOR). &nbsp;This should be made in each case recording in full detail as to what has actually happened and what steps should be taken in future to avoid recurrence. </p><p>The UORs should basically contain the following details:</p><p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp; Report of Drivers detailing all his observations, together with remarks of engine examiner or other official if any.<br />ii) Observations made by Maintenance Organization i.e. Technical Investigation section, Maintenance Foreman and AEE/DEE(RS). </p><p>UORs should be serially numbered for each calendar year to identify the homing shed, class of loco and serial number of the occurrence for the class of loco/EMU during the year e.g. TATA/WAG5/3/2016. A copy of all UORs.should be forwarded to CEE&rsquo;s office periodically. </p>",
		"<p><strong>Answer :</strong> <br />One unit of electrical energy at users end needs four unit of primary fuel. Conservation of energy can be done up to 40% or even more. Indian Railways spends about 22% of its budget toward energy bill.<br />The following steps may be taken by TRS for energy conservation &ndash;<br />1. Use gradient for coasting. Level section can be also used for coasting by following proper driving technique.<br />2. Number of schedule/ unscheduled speed restriction should be minimum. Avoid late lowering of signals. Control chain pulling.<br />3. Talk to engineering department for realignment of track for reduction in length of track, reduction in curve, reduction in speed restrictions, reduction in gradients etc.<br />4. Promote use of LWR (Long Welded Rail) for low track resistance. Monitor profile of rail and wheel after studying the usefulness.<br />5. Lubricate outer flange of the curved rail for reduction in resistance between rolling stock wheel flange and rail.<br />6. Power factor correction in loco will reduce losses.<br />7. Aerodynamic design of loco/ coach/wagon will reduce the air resistance. Reduce weight of coach and wagon.<br />8. Train drivers for driving technique. Provide energy meter to monitor. Release brakes fully before starting. Switch off auxiliary when not required. Provide coasting boards at all suitable locations.&nbsp; <br />9. Switch off electric locos (coordinate with operating department) when idle for more than 45 minutes. Avoid running of trains via loops. Improve brake power of the train and control brake binding in the train. <br />10. Avoid use of resistance in locomotives. Use tube lights and FRP fan blades in EMU/coaches/locos. <br />11. Regenerative braking control is useful for energy conservation upto70 to 80 %.<br />12. Avoid running of light /dead locos. Repair in nearest loco shed.<br />13. Reduce running of empty racks. Minimize the running of EMU in holidays. <br />14. Reduce friction by replacement of worn out bearing, by timely lubricating and air leakages in loco and coaches. </p>",
		"<strong>Answer :</strong><br />1. In static converter output voltage is balance in three phases which is suitable to run three phase auxiliary motor.<br />2. As static device maintenance is very less and also due to no vibration effect on&nbsp;&nbsp; surrounding equipment is nil.<br />3. As static device, no frictional loss.<br />4. Harmonic distortion is minimized utilizing sine filter causing save in energy.<br />5. Protection system is multi directional such as earth fault, over current, over voltage, under voltage etc.<br />6. Starting system is easy with soft equipment.<br />7. Power factor is higher (near about unity).&nbsp; <br />8. As voltage is balance the life of auxiliary motor increases. <br />9. Fault indication system is prominent, so operator friendly.</p>",
		"<strong>Answer- </strong><br />This relay is used to give the indication that converter output voltage is fully developed i.e. 3 phase AC, 415V. The battery negative is directly connected to the relay and positive (wire no.700) is routed through potential free contact of converter.<br />When the converter is in &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; condition, the potential free contact is also open means QCON relay not in energized condition. But when converter is in &ldquo;ON&rdquo; condition and develops full voltage, the potential free contact closes and positive path to QCON relay completed and relay energized. Two NO contact ofQCON is used in control logic of compressor circuit, which ensures that compressor will start only after converter fully developed voltage.</p>",
		"<strong>Answer- </strong><br />This relay is used to give the indication that there are some fault (internal/ external) due to which converter is tripped. This relay also opens the DJ. The battery negative is directly connected to the relay and positive (wire no.700) is routed through potential free contact of converter. When the converter is in &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; condition, the potential free contact is also open means QSIT  relay not in energized condition. But if the converter trips three consecutive times due to any reason internal/external (except fuse fault) then on fourth time this potential free contact will close and complete the positive path and QSIT  relay energizes. Two NC contacts of QSIT  are used in control logic of DJ circuit branch, which opens the DJ, and make impossible to close DJ till we reset the converter. Resetting can be done by pressing the<br />reset switch provided in MCU card or Reset switch provided near SIV &ldquo;ON&rdquo; switch. But the easy way to resetting is just switch &ldquo;OFF /ON&rdquo; the HBA.</p>",
